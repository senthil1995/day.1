                            1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 (HTTP-Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

               HTTP1.1
1 It works on the textual format.

2 it compresses data by itself.

3 It uses requests resources inlining for use getting multiple passes.

4 There is head of the line blocking all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources.

5 There is a problem which is creating a persistent connection between server and client

6 There are other problems, such as plain text header being sent that are large, especially when cookies are in use.

7 It doesn't offer a way to prioritise requests, which could lead to less critical resources blocking more important ones.

8 In the document are likely various assets.
things like images, stylesheets (CSS file).
and Javascript assets (js files). 

9 These limitations often lead to inefficient
use of network resources as subsequent requests had to wait for the previous request to complete.

10 Lack of prioritization.


                            HTTP 2
1 It works on the binary protocol.

2 It uses HPACK for data compression.

3 It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.

4 It allows multiplexing, so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

5 Using bottleneck layer partition the client and the server problem is resolved.

6. It enables client to prioritise, allowing more. critical resources to be fetched and rendered
first. 

7 It relies on the same underlying protocol in order to operate: TCP

8 In this it works differently using multiplexing the browser effectively requests the assets together, and then receives in same way.

9 Server can proactively push resources to the clients cache before they requested, to reduce latency and improve overall user experience

10 Improved in prioritization.
